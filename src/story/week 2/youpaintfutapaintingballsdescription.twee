Before you start painting you realize it might be fun to see if you can balance a testicle on your paintbrush.  The thickest one should work best for this.  You can almost raise the testicle an inch but it always slides off to the side of the brush.  After 3 tries, you get bored when you realize how difficult the task really is.

Time to get to business.  Using broad strokes, you cover the scrotum in a thick $you_paint_futa_current_color coat.

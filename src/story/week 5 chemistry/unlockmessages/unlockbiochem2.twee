The next week you give Mrs. Curie a tour of the school and some of AB's assistants set up her lab.  Unlike Ms. Tink, she has never worked with AB before, though she knows of their existence.  That's a little disappointing as you were hoping to pry a little about AB's background.

She seems to settle into her daily routine quickly, but she's obsessed with her work.  Rather than teach, she requests some initial alone time where she can put her head down and research without the students distracting from her work.

You're a little hesitant, but she assures you she was on the cusp of something very creative before she got fired, something you'd be very interested in.  You decide to give her a chance to see what she'll come up with.

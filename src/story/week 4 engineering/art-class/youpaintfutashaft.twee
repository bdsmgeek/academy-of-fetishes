<<set _big to (not $futa_painting_uncircumcised)>><<set $finished_futa_painting_shaft to true>>You cradle the soft penis and lift it behind her so you're looking down on the sensitive underside.  <<if $futa_painting_uncircumcised>>It's so tiny. Thin as your pinky and maybe even shorter.  You place it between your index and thumb and stroke it up and down.  It barely grows, but you do feel it harden, so you keep going for a while until you realize that's as big as it's going to get.  "Wow," you say, "I was expecting the foreskin to pull back."

Ms. Monet says, "Seems to be a case of phimosis.  I think it's very cute."<</if>><<if _big>>You pet it like a cat with your other hand.  You feel it brush across all the fingers of your bottom hand as it grows perpendicular to them.

You rest your thumb across a vein.  "Mmmm, I feel her pulse," you say to yourself.  It's so warm in your hand you don't want to stop stroking.  Unfortunately, it's starting to leak and you don't want to make a mess on yourself.<</if>>

The barn's made of wooden planks and colored a traditional red.  It does a good job at protecting the animals from the elements.  Speaking of animals, AB donated a pig, horse, and two sheep dogs, but strangely, no sheep.  They're a handful to take care of, but the students seem to enjoy it.  The rest of the week passes without incident.

You walk to Luna and Amy and see what they're up to.  Amy is face up with her head on Luna's lap and Luna is feeding her grapes.  You rest your hand on Luna's shoulder and ask, "Are you having fun, dear?"

She looks up at you and smiles.  "Yes <<maam>>.  I love taking care of Amy."  Amy opens her mouth to indicate that she wants another grape so Luna lowers the vine.

All the trans girls are very timid but you were hoping this experiment would break Luna out of her shell.  Unfortunately, she hasn't figured that out on her own.  You think she might need a little coaching.

Mia jumps in her bed and gets comfortable.  Before you leave, she looks up and says, "Thanks for helping me," she pauses for a large yawn.  When she finishes she completes her sentence, "with all those problems you caused."

You chuckle in your head.  She scoots over to the edge of her bed and pats on the other side.  "Do you wanna sleep here with me?  There's plenty of room."

"Aww," you say.  "That's very thoughtful, but I should really..." she's already asleep.  You walk over and tuck her in and do the same with Olivia on your way out.

Now you start to get the idea.  As the student's bend forward, gravity pulls their baggy shirts down and gives Mrs. Ball a "down blouse" view.

"5... 4... 3... 2... 1...," Mrs. Ball counts down slowly as her eyes dart around from student to student.  "OK, next exercise.  50 jumping jacks."  halfway through the jumping jacks Mrs. Ball whispers to you, "I force them to wear regular bras which aren't really built to support them when they're doing strenuous exercise like this."

When everyone has finished, Mrs. Ball tells them to do a 180 and perform a downward facing dog.  The students spread their legs and touch the floor with their palms.  A row of blue shorts face you and their stretch exposes a little bit of buttock.  More importantly, gravity slides the baggy shirts off the students' backs.  For most of the students the shirt catches on their necks and goes inside out around their arms as if they were halfway through the process of taking their tops off.  Everyone's bra is exposed and the shirt creates a natural blindfold over their heads.

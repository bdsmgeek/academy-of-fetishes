When you enter the gym, there's an empty stage with an empty podium.  There's only one row of seats and it's only occupied by teachers.  Behind the stage is a large black curtain and you can tell the students are behind it because Sarah's got her head poking out.  When she sees you, her head disappears and the waving curtains are the only evidence she was ever there in the first place.  The gym is massive so the curtain can't stretch from one end to the other, but it's obvious you're not supposed to look behind it, so you take your seat with the rest of the teachers.  They saved you one right at the center.

Ms. Monet makes her way up the stage, grabs a mic off the podium, and steps to the side, letting everyone see her body.  "Welcome." She looks back at the curtain and says, "We've put a lot of effort into this show, so I'm glad you could all join us."  Facing forward, she tilts her chin up and says, "Dim the lights, please."  Behind the curtain, you hear a light switch click, and every other light in the gym turns off.  It's still pretty bright, but it sets the appropriate mood.  

"Good," Ms. Monet says.  She smiles and says, "I'll be your Emcee tonight, but I admit I didn't really prepare for this part because we were so busy with the costumes.  Maybe I should explain what we're going to do."   She looks inward, then she says, "No... no... Perhaps it's best we just get into it?  Yeah, I think that's the way to go."  She pulls the mic away from her face, looks over her shoulder, and whispers, "Are you ready?" to the curtain.  You don't hear a response, but Ms. Monet faces the audience with a smile. <<include "CostumeShowNextScene">>

When the last act has left the stage, Ms. Monet says, "I hope you liked our little show.  The girls and I worked very hard on it, and I'm happy to say I was more of a facilitator than anything.  Most of the ideas were their own, I just helped where I was needed.  How about we give our students a round of applause?" When the teachers clap, all the students run on stage, hold hands, and take a bow like they would at the end of a play.  Once the applause has died down, Ms. Monet says, "Once again, I hope you enjoyed our little show.  We're going to clean up around here, then we'll be free to enjoy the rest of our weekend."

You decide to stick around and help clean up some trash.  But, like everyone, you're anxious to go back to your room to relax.

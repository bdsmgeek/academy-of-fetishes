You smile as you look past Mrs. Ball to glance at one of the pony girls pulling her wheelbarrow.  "My, my," you say, "I completely forgot what their outfits looked like.  They look great.  It is a little hot though.  Are you sure they're not overheating?"

Mrs. Ball points at a trough at the end of the field.  "We were just heading over there to get a drink.  Would you like to join me?  The wheelbarrow's wide enough for the both of us."  One of the pony girls groans then exhales sharply through her nose, but Mrs. Ball doesn't seem to notice.  "Or, I can give you a tour of the place first.  What do you think?"

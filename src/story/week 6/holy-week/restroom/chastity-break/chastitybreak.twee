::  ChastityBreak
<<set $finished_chastity_bathroom_break to true>>\
The students have three scheduled breaks a day to be released from their chastity belts.  After PE, they're allowed to remove their devices so they can take a shower, and after lunch and dinner they're allowed to take them off to go to the restroom.  Of course, this is under heavy supervision by a teacher, because the students aren't to be trusted in their aroused state.  They may sneak off and masturbate somewhere, ruining the whole point of Holy Week.

The supervision required is taxing for the teachers.  For the bathroom breaks, long lines form at the restrooms, and a teacher has to stand watch to make sure the students behave.  For the showers, you debated between having multiple teachers stand watch, but to do that, you'd have to end multiple classes early.  You just don't have the staff to support this, so you have Mrs. Ball end every PE class early instead, and only a few students get to shower at the same time, so like the restrooms, long lines form as the students wait for their turn.  Since Nurse Neadle's usually free, you have her help Mrs. Ball out so more students can shower at once.

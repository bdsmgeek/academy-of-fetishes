After a few minutes of eating, Mrs. Ball's able to rest her foot flat on the gag, but the pressure caused a lot of the scat to squish out to the sides of her foot, so Mrs. Ball scrape it back into the hole with her toes, creating another pile.  She then pushes that down while plugging Kira's nose and saying, "Faster."  The students eyes dart around as if she's trying to find something that can save her from the predicament.  Once Kira swallows enough for Mrs. Ball to lay her foot flat on the gag, she unplugs Kira's nose.  There's still a condensed pile of soft scat in Kira's mouth.  

"Tasty huh?" Mrs. Ball says as she pats Kira's shoulder and gives her a chance to recover.  Although you can't hear Kira's words, you can tell from the tone and the tears that she's begging for mercy.  Once the break's over, Mrs. Ball sticks her toes into the gag hole to push more of it down, and Kira has no choice but to swallow.  

Eventually, Kira's swallowed so much that Mrs. Ball's toes can't reach the rest of it, but Kira still hasn't swallowed it all.  "That's good enough for now.  I'll give you a minute."  Kira sighs through her nose.  Her eyes close to little slits as she sobs.  You wonder if she's thinking about all the filth she just swallowed or scared about what's to happen next.

"OK, times up."  Instead of sticking her foot back into the gag, Mrs. Ball crawls on the floor to scoop up the smattering of feces strewn about from Kira's released enema. <<include "KiraForceFeedScatEnemaSnippet">>

You tell the mothers to cross their legs and have the daughters lay across their laps, similar to how a baby would while nursing.

"Look into your daughter's eyes," you say.  You see a lot of loving expressions, almost like this is a bonding experience.  "Stroke your daughter's cheeks and hair.  Make them feel comfortable."

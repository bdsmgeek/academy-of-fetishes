Two minutes into typing up the day's activities, your computer chimes, indicating that you've received a new email.  It's from AB.  In polite terms, they suggest you may have forgotten to send today's email.  You smirk, knowing that if you'd woken up five minutes earlier, maybe you could have gotten away with them not noticing.

As you preface the email with an apology, you freeze.  There's a sound coming from the halls: footsteps, and they’re getting closer.  Someone's running down the hall.  Your whole body clenches.  Your eyes are locked on the textured glass on your door's window.  A figure fleets by.  The hallway lights turn off, and the double doors leading to the walkway slam closed.

You spring into action, running toward your door.  Somehow you know you're chasing AB.  The timing's too perfect for it to be anyone else.  You don't have time to consider what you'll do if you catch them, you just move.

::  BirthdayPartyMomsLaySnuggle
When you tell the mothers to snuggle their daughters, most of them tuck an arm behind their daughter's back and lift them up.  You see lots of Eskimo kisses.  Many daughters reach around their mom's backs in an embrace.  Some couples even kiss.

"Remember," you say.  "Let's just snuggle for now.  I'll give you more instructions soon."

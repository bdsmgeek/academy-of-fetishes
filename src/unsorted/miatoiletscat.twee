::  MiaToiletScat
On camera you catch Mia walking into the restroom.  Before the door shuts she yells, "I'll see you in class soon!"  When the door closes, she giggles and whispers, "But don't wait up."  She frowns and rubs her belly as she walks to a stall then adds, "Because I've been holding this in since I woke up."

It seems what Mia's trying to not-so-subtly say is, she needs to go 'Number 2.'

[[That's not my thing.  Go back to your Office.->Office]]

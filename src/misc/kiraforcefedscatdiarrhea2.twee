::  KiraForceFedScatDiarrhea2
"Mmm, tasty huh?"  Mrs. Ball pats Kira's shoulder and gives her a chance to recover, but soon she scrapes some filth off the floor and dribbles it into the gag.  Compared to what Kira just swallowed, it's not much, but Kira struggles to swallow it.  After her neck muscles strain to push the sludge down, she pants and sticks her tongue out of the gag.  Mrs. Ball tilts her head back in disgust and waves her hand in front of her nose, but she's happy to see Kira swallow without needing to be pinched this time.  Without delay, Mrs. Ball scoops up some more and slides it into the gag.

This continues for minutes, but Mrs. Ball has always liked challenging her students, so she picks up the pace along the way, sometimes giving Kira more before she's swallowed the previous bite.  By the time she's transferred all the diarrhea, Kira's mouth is half full again, and since she's struggling to keep up, Mrs. Ball decides to plug her nose, even though Kira's been doing her best to swallow it.  Kira's eyelashes flutter as she watches the cruel PE teacher sneer down at her, and once again, the gentle bubbles float to the top of her mouth as the liquid drains into her stomach.  Before the last of it goes down her tube, Kira makes a gurgling sound that churns your stomach.

Next, Mrs. Ball scoops up the smattering of feces strewn about the floor from Kira's released enema. <<include "KiraForceFeedScatEnemaSnippet">>

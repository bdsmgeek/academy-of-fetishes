That night, you had a wonderful dream, but you can't remember what it was about.  Regardless, when you wake up, it puts you in a good mood.  When you think about what Ms. Waterloo said last night, you decide to give her permission to tell her class about you being intersex.  She asks if you want to be present, but you turn her down because you don't want to see the students' reactions.

For the rest of the day, you feel like you're on edge.  Every time a person knocks on your office door, you get startled.  But at the end of the day, Ms. Waterloo comes to your office and tells you that everything went over just like she said it would.  Nobody was judgemental, nobody said anything mean, but everyone wants to see you nude and 'play' with you.  After you thank her and she leaves, you can't believe how relieved you feel.  This is something you should have done months ago.  You can't wait to visit the next class.

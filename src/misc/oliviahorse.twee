It was fun watching Kira and Mia play with max, so you decide to visit the farm again.  Unfortunately, they don't seem to be playing with Max today.  Mrs. Ball may have noticed that they went missing the last time you visited, and she seems to be keeping a watchful eye on them.

The farm does have a horse.  Maybe you could find an interested student when PE ends?  If memory serves you right, Olivia has experience riding horses.  She'd probably be a good candidate.

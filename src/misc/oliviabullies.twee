::  OliviaBullies
You watch the hall cameras and see Olivia with a group of her friends.  Her short, blond hair stands out from the rest of the students.

Another student walks past on her way to class.  Olivia turns and says something to her, but you can't make out what it is with all the ambient conversations in the hallway.  Whatever she said makes the student frown and hunch over then walk a bit faster to get to her class.  Olivia and the group she's with all laugh together.

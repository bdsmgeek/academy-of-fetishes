"Good job," you say to them both.  "That was wonderful.  Think you can go another round?" Hannah shakes her head.  "Here."  You start scribbling a note and hand it to Anna.  "I've got to put your device back on, but this is a hall pass.  You can use it later whenever you get the urge to take it off again."  You turn to Hannah. "And as promised, I'll turn your device off so you can get a good nights sleep.  I'm sure you two would like to wash up first.  When you're done with that, we'll all go back to our rooms.  Unless you would like to sleep together?  No?"  Unfortunately, they don't take you up on your offer.  But that's alright, they already did a lot tonight.

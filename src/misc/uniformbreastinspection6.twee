Mrs. Ball gets down on one knee and lifts the breast away from the ground.  It looks like it's surprisingly heavy and taut.  But the problem is Jessie's nipple is not at a great angle to apply a clothespin.  To fix this, Mrs. Ball squeezes her hand and applies pressure with her thumb to form a crease in the breast.  She smiles at the obvious discomfort this causes Jessie, but it has done its job: The breast has folded upward and the nipple is now in view.

She grabs a clothespin and applies it carelessly to Jessie's nipple.  Jessie gasps and jolts her breast away by shifting her weight, but the clip has already secured itself.  She shakes her breast a few more times while screaming through her shirt.  When her brain catches up to the idea that the shaking isn't helping, she stops.  Her screams subside and she resorts to gritting her teeth and breathing heavily through her mouth.  A few more seconds pass and you can hear pathetic whimpering from behind the shirt.

Because the clothespin is applied so carelessly, it is not completely attached to the nipple: Only a corner of the clothespin is making contact with the skin.  "This isn't completely covering your vulgar nipple.  We're going to have to reapply it."
